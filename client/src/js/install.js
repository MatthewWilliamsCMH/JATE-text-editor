//Here's what's happening.
//1. The browser detects whether or not the site can be installed as a PWA (beforeinstallprompt fires when it detects that it can, usually on page load)
//2. If true is returned, the install button is made available.
//3. If the user clicks install, the app is installed as a PWA (where is the logic for this?) and the install button is disabled.
//4. Once the PWA is installed, the text header is changed to let the user know the installation was successful.
